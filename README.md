Tenzies Game

A fast-paced dice game built in React. Roll ten dice, holding those you want to keep, until all show the same number. Features automatic win detection, roll tracking, and interactive UI.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with React state management by structuring and updating state across parent and child components. I practiced using functional programming techniques like map() to render dynamic lists, and applied useRef and useEffect to control side effects and reference DOM elements efficiently. I also improved my approach to conditional rendering for a responsive UI, and focused on making the application interface accessible to all users.
